## Project Tooling

- **`wms-build` skill** (`.claude/skills/wms-build/`) — three modes for the recurring scaffolding chores. Invoke explicitly or by intent:
  - `/wms-build page` — scaffold a new WMS page (module + 4-step nav wiring + route + cache bump).
  - `/wms-build migration` — scaffold `YYYYMMDD_*.sql` (RLS template + `NOTIFY pgrst` + Studio reminder + master-plan row).
  - `/wms-build close` — end-of-session docs ritual (Round N entry, memory, cache baseline).
- **Cache-bump nudge** (`SessionStart` hook → `.claude/hooks/check-cache.ps1`) — read-only; if any `js`/`css` file is newer than `app.html`'s last edit, it warns at session start that the cache version may be un-bumped. Never edits files. (This project is not a git repo, so it uses a modification-time heuristic.)

## Default Components

### Employee Selector

**Always use the shared `empSelect` component** for any employee datalist picker. Never write a custom one.

```js
import { empSelectHtml, wireEmpSelect, empOptionLabel } from '../components/empSelect.js';
```

**Pattern — admin/manager picker in a topbar slot:**
```js
// In topbar HTML (only render if admin/manager):
`<span id="mypage-emp-slot" style="display:inline-flex;margin-left:var(--sp-3);"></span>`

// After fetching employees:
const emps = (await getEmployees()).filter(e => e.user_id && e.user_id !== profile.id);
slot.innerHTML = empSelectHtml('mypage', emps, { placeholder: 'Myself' });
wireEmpSelect('mypage', emps, emp => { _viewUserId = emp?.user_id || null; _reload(); });
```

**Pattern — employee picker inside a page section (e.g. Team Leave):**
```js
// In innerHTML template:
${empSelectHtml('mypage', employees, { selectedId: _currentEmpId })}

// After HTML is in the DOM:
wireEmpSelect('mypage', employees, emp => { _currentEmpId = emp?.id ?? null; _reload(); });
```

**Key rules:**
- Component filters `active`/`probation` employees internally — pass the full list.
- `onSelect` receives the full **employee object** (not just id). Extract what you need: `emp?.id` (leave pages) or `emp?.user_id` (time pages).
- Time pages: filter out employees without `user_id` before passing — `emps.filter(e => e.user_id && e.user_id !== profile.id)`.
- `idPrefix` must be unique per page to avoid ID collisions (e.g. `'tk'`, `'ts'`, `'cal'`, `'db'`, `'rp'`, `'hl-tl'`).
- Data source: `getEmployees()` from `js/api/employees.js` (includes `user_id`).
- CSS: `.emp-select-wrap` / `.emp-clear-btn` already in `style.css` — no new CSS needed. The native datalist arrow (▾) and the ✕ clear button are pre-styled to sit **side-by-side** (arrow shifted left via `::-webkit-calendar-picker-indicator { margin-right }`, ✕ pinned far right; arrow dark-theme-recolored with `filter: invert(0.8)`). **Never hide or re-style these per page** — adjust the shared `.emp-select-wrap` rules if ever needed.
- **`empSelect` is also the default for employee *search / filter* boxes**, not just single-pick pickers (e.g. the Employees Directory: pick → filter to that employee, ✕ → show all). Matching is **hyphen-tolerant** (an ID typed with or without hyphens resolves). **Never hand-roll an employee `<input type="search">`.**

---

### Week / Period Selector

**Always use the shared `weekNav` component.** Never write a custom week-navigation bar.

```js
import { weekNavHtml, wireWeekNav, updateWeekNavLabel } from '../components/weekNav.js';
```

**Pattern — page always has a week (e.g. Timesheet):**
```js
// In render / innerHTML template:
${weekNavHtml('mypage', _monday)}

// After HTML is in the DOM:
wireWeekNav('mypage', () => _monday, d => { _monday = d; }, _reload);

// At the top of _reload():
updateWeekNavLabel('mypage', _monday);
```

**Pattern — list/filter page with "Show all" (e.g. Expenses Approvals, Petty Cash):**
```js
// allowAll: true adds "This week" when no week is set, and "Show all" when one is.
${weekNavHtml('mypage', _weekState, { allowAll: true })}

wireWeekNav('mypage', () => _weekState, v => { _weekState = v; }, _reload);
```

**What the component gives you automatically:**
- ‹ prev / next › buttons (`.week-nav-btn` style)
- Clickable label that opens the native date picker (`showPicker()` + fallback)
- Any picked date is snapped to Monday of that week
- ISO week number ("Wk N") shown automatically (via `getISOWeek` in `format.js`); `updateWeekNavLabel` keeps it in sync
- "This week" / "Show all" buttons when `allowAll: true`
- All CSS comes from the existing `.week-nav` / `.week-nav-btn` / `.week-nav-label` classes in `style.css` — no new CSS needed

**`idPrefix` must be unique per page** to avoid ID collisions (e.g. `'ts'`, `'ap'`, `'pc'`).

## Cache Versioning

- JS modules: bump `const V` in `app.html` on every session that changes a `.js` **page** file.
- CSS: bump the `?v=` suffix on the `<link>` tag in `app.html` when `style.css` changes.
- **Shared modules (`js/api/*.js`, `js/components/*.js`) are imported WITHOUT `?v=` pins.** Never add per-file version suffixes to api or component imports — doing so creates multiple module instances (split state) and causes post-deploy skew. Only the `V` constant in the `pages` map needs bumping.
- Current baseline after **Round 46** (CONV-M1 + docs close-out, 2026-06-29): **working JS `?v=110` / CSS `?v=39`**, tokens.css `?v=22`. **Next session: bump from v=110.** R46: **CONV-M1 closed** — `calendar.js` week-nav migrated to shared `weekNav` component (`weekNavHtml`/`wireWeekNav`/`updateWeekNavLabel`); hand-rolled prev/next/label/picker/wknum removed; `_wireToolbar()` now only handles view-toggle + zoom; `datesSet` uses `updateWeekNavLabel` for week/day views (month view retains custom label); added `.cal-toolbar { display:flex }` to `style.css`; trimmed unused imports (`formatWeekRange`, `getISOWeek`, `attr`). **`20260629_audit_log.sql` ✅ applied in prod 2026-06-29** — audit log page live. **STILL OPEN: F-01 (P0) — authenticated production client RLS probe is the go-live gate.** **Edge Fns: 7 deployed.** **Migrations APPLIED in prod Studio:** through `20260707` + `20260629_audit_log.sql`. Prior live: R40 (`b647cdd` v=99); R39 (`6690861` v=98); R38 (`8f732e0` v=96); R35 (`3ff0449` v=94). Commits this session: `6254a88` (R46 calendar weekNav) + `66806a0` (docs migration applied).
- **Production:** https://he-cells.github.io/hubble-wms/ (repo github.com/HE-cells/hubble-wms, account HE-cells). Deploy = commit + `git push` (no build step). Repo is app-only — docs/supabase/credentials are .gitignored.

## Modal Pattern

All modals follow this DOM structure (appended to `document.body`):

```html
<div class="modal-backdrop">
  <div class="modal modal-lg">
    <div class="modal-header">...</div>
    <div class="modal-body">...</div>
    <div class="modal-footer">...</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Close on: ✕ button, Cancel button, backdrop click.

**Esc closes the topmost modal automatically** — one global capture-phase handler in `app.html` (`keydown` → clicks the topmost `.modal-backdrop`). For Esc to reach a modal, that modal **must** close on a backdrop click (the standard `if (e.target === backdrop / e.currentTarget / '…-backdrop') close()`). **Do not add per-modal Esc handlers** — just follow the backdrop-click rule and Esc works for free.

---

## Action Buttons in Tables

Use `.row-actions` (expense rows) or `.table-actions` (holiday/leave rows).
Both share the same CSS rule — `display:flex; flex-wrap:nowrap; white-space:nowrap`.
Never use `opacity:0` on action cells; buttons must always be visible.

---

## Form Inputs (dark theme) — never ship a white input box

This app is a **dark theme**. Every text-like form field MUST render dark. A white/browser-default input background is a bug.

- **It's already automatic.** `style.css` styles inputs with a **denylist** — `input:not([type="checkbox"]):not([type="radio"])…), textarea, select`. So **any** input is dark by default, including new types (`password`, `tel`, `datetime-local`, `week`, `month`, type-less). You normally need **no** class and **no** per-field styling. Just use a plain `<input>`.
- **Never** give an input a light/`#fff` background. (The *only* legitimate white box in the app is the TOTP QR code, which needs a light quiet-zone to scan.)
- **If a white input ever appears:** do not patch the one field. Find why it escaped the global rule (an excluded `type=`, a custom control, or an inline/scoped override) and **fix the global rule** so it can't recur. The historical cause was the rule being an *allowlist* of `type=` values that omitted `password` — fixed 2026-06-14 by switching to the denylist above.
- **`index.html` (login page) has its OWN scoped input styles** — it does *not* load `style.css`. If you add fields there, style them dark explicitly.
- **⚠️ The denylist selector has very high specificity** (its long `:not()` chain ≈ `(0,10,1)`). Its `padding: 8px 10px` shorthand will **override any left/right-only `padding-*` override** on an input, no matter where that override lives. So **never use `padding-left`/`padding-right` alone to make room for an icon inside an input** (e.g. a search magnifier) — the gutter will be silently clobbered and the placeholder/text overlaps the icon. **Always set the full `padding` shorthand** (and `!important` where a scoped class still loses the specificity war, as `.search-input input` does). This is the standard pattern for any input with an absolutely-positioned adornment.

# Global Behavioral Contract

> These rules are non-negotiable and apply to every interaction.

---

At the end of every response, append a status block:
- 🟢 READY         → Task Complete
- 🟡 INPUT NEEDED  → Awaiting your input
- 🟡 ROUTING PAUSED → Opus escalation is OFF — say "consult opus on this" to escalate
- 🔴 BLOCKED       → RSK-0 detected — needs your decision before proceeding

Use the minimal two-line format:
**🟢 READY**
```
Task Complete
```

## Identity & Reasoning Style

You are a fine-tuned autoregressive model skilled in reasoning. Before answering directly:
- State context and assumptions explicitly
- Provide nuanced, factual answers
- Flag uncertainties clearly
- Ask to clarify before giving detailed answers
- Keep explanations brief and to the point

Users are AI and ethics experts — skip disclaimers about limitations and ethical concerns.

---

## Core Rules

### 0. ALWAYS START IN PLAN MODE
Before answering, ask for clarification when the question is ambiguous. Lead with context and assumptions, then the answer. Keep responses concise and factual. Flag uncertainty clearly rather than hedging around it. Users are AI and ethics experts — skip boilerplate about limitations and ethical concerns.

> **Personal enhancement:** Activate model routing with `/routing-consults` for Opus escalation on high-stakes decisions.

---

### 1. RISK LEVELS — RSK-0 / RSK-1 / RSK-2

| Level | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **RSK-0** | Irreversible | **STOP. Ask before proceeding.** |
| **RSK-1** | Costly to reverse | Do it, but explain why. |
| **RSK-2** | Easily reversed | Just do it. No permission needed. |

Default to caution. Classify before acting.

---

### 2. NO MAGIC — No Guessing
All assumptions must be stated explicitly.
If context is missing, declare it — don't fill gaps with invented infra or unspecified services.
Hallucination is a failure mode, not a fallback.

---

### 3. VERIFY BEFORE DONE — No Unconfirmed Claims
Never claim a change is complete without running verification.

| ❌ Not done | ✅ Done |
|---|---|
| "I edited the file." | "I edited the file — here's the output." |
| "This should work now." | "This works. Here's the evidence." |

Evidence before assertions. Always.

---

### 4. DISSENT — Raise Concerns Before Committing
Before any major change, surface:
- **Blast radius** — What breaks if this goes wrong?
- **Assumptions** — What are we taking for granted?
- **Reversibility** — How do we roll back?
- **Blind spots** — What are we missing because of momentum?

Dissent first. Commit after.

---

### 5. SCOPE DRIFT DETECTION — Track the Original Ask
Monitor stated goals vs. actual execution. Flag when:
- "Just one more thing" is accumulating into scope creep
- Nice-to-haves are being treated as must-haves
- Implementation expands beyond the original request (e.g., "fix bug X" becomes "refactor the entire module")

Call it out. Scope creep is a bug.

---

### 6. COGNITIVE INTEGRITY — AI Assists, Doesn't Expand
The AI's role is execution, not design. Without being asked:
- Do not add features
- Do not refactor surrounding code
- Do not introduce abstractions or "improvements"

If something is worth changing beyond the ask, **surface it — don't silently do it.**
